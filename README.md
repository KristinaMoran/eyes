# eyes
The Eyes program has a set of eyes in the window that follow the movements of the cursor across the screen making it appear as though they are watching the movements.

## How to Run

Download index.html, styles.css and eyes.js files to the same directory on your computer. Load the index.html file into your browser. Move the cursor around in the window and watch as the eyes appear to follow it.
